\section*{Introduction}

\parskip 0.8ex
BUILD is a tutoring service, offered by CalCorps, that provides
after-school 1-to-1 tutoring for students at 11 elementary schools
in the Berkeley Unified School District (BUSD).
Teachers and literacy coaches at schools identify potential tutees'
by reading ability and availability after school.

In the year 2014-15, a total of 476 students participated in the
BUILD tutoring program. The number of tutoring sessions ranged
from 1 to 86, with an average of 15.6.
For the evaluation of this program, we have access to the BUSD
administrative records, including the district's reading assessments,
given 3 times per year, as well as student background information
(race/ethnicity, gender, SES, primary language spoken at home)
for all K-5 students in Berkeley Unified School District ($N = 4,252$).
The data analyzed is for a subset of students, for which the district
assessment data and tutoring session information are available
for two more years (2012-13, 2013-14).

\section*{Data and Methodology}

%------------------------------------------------

\subsection*{Data}

The data is entirely observational.
The treatment -- that is, tutoring -- was not randomly assigned,
as a number of factors impacted whether students were able
to participate in the program.

The data is hierarchical in nature -- that is, there is a
nesting structure, with schools ($n=11$) being at the highest level,
followed by teachers ($n=201$), and then students ($n=4,252$),
with the longitudinal outcome being reading measurements
(administered 3 times per year to all students).

The longitudinal outcome measure is the
Teacher's College Reading \& Writing Project (TCRWP).
Scores for each student are transformed via a scaling procedure
such that each single point of the examined score represents
one year of growth in reading ability.
The exam is administered individually to each student
in the Fall, Winter, and Spring terms.

\subsection*{Methods - Exploratory Analysis}

In order to explore any relationships potentially present
in the data, a number of exploratory models were fit,
all using ordinary least squares (OLS).
The full model, with an interaction term for treatment and grade,
was fit first. This model was compared to a main-effects model
lacking the covariate race.
As a final step, the simplest model, including only
post-test score and pre-exam score, was fit.
A comparison revealed the main-effects model had the lowest AIC,
with an $R^{2}$ similar to that of the most complex model.
Thus, terms included in this model were chosen for use in the
longitudinal analyses to analyze the effect of tutoring on
reading ability growth.

Model~\ref{eq:model1} is a dynamic model, fit using GEE,
with an exchangeable correlation structure and
robust standard errors.
In a given semester, the post-test score is regressed
on the previous test score,
the number of tutoring sessions in that semester,
and controls.
The parameter of interest is $\beta_2$, the
effect for \textit{one tutoring session},
for those who attended tutoring regularly.

Model~\ref{eq:model2} is a dynamic model with a random intercept,
and robust standard errors, using the same
fixed effects as Model~1.
The parameter of interest is $\beta_2$, the
within-student effect of \textit{one tutoring session},
among those who attended tutoring regularly.

Model~\ref{eq:model3} is a cross-sectional model, where the
entire history of each student has been collapsed into a
single observation.
The most recent post-test score is regressed on
the first pre-test score we have for that student,
the number of semesters since the first test,
the total number of tutoring sessions (during regular attendance),
and controls.
The parameter of interest is $\beta_2$, the
within-student effect of \textit{one tutoring session},
over their academic history.

In all cases, the longitudinal models fit reveal that
the best predictor of post-test score is the most recent
pre-test score.
While differences in reading ability (controlling for pre-test)
were predicted by grade level, this effect is most easily
interpreted as differences in reading ability development
of children; this is corroborated by the significance of the
estimated coefficient for the number of semesters since
student enrollment.
In regard to our question of interest, it was found that the
number of tutoring sessions
(and the number of semesters a student received tutoring)
had a (slightly) negative effect on student performance, 
nterpreted as falling behind in reading ability.

The trajectory plot illustrates the growth of students over
time as assessed by the TCRWP scores administered several
times per academic year.
As expected, the performance of students increases over time,
though modeling reveals that tutoring is unlikely to be the
cause of this growth.

\section*{Conclusions and Further Considerations}

\begin{itemize}
\setlength\itemsep{0.5ex}
\item All of the analyses, including the GEE, random intercept,
and cross-sectional history models, show that tutoring
was not effective in improving reading scores,
while the best predictor of the post-test score
-- in any term -- was the pre-test score
(the score from the previous term).
\item The observed data structure is quite complicated,
as illustrated by the causal DAG below.
There are limitations to the methods discussed;
in future work, care ought to be taken to account for the
causal relationships between the covariates, treatment,
and outcome in the investigations -- in particular,
time-varying confounding is clearly present.
