Project Title: _An Examination of Tutoring Efficacy in Schools_

These are just materials for the poster produced for this data analysis project.

Reflections:

-   Sans-serif fonts look better in large format

-   "Dynamic" models should be called "Transitional"

-   "Cross-sectional" model should be called "Cumulative".

-   Use confidence intervals instead of standard errors.
